# User Evaluation

We gathered some feedback from users, described below. The main bullet points are taken directly (verbatim) from the users' 
feedback, with notes about fixes and other comments.  

## User 1

* Not mobile friendly
  * Addressed in #51 and #69
* Nothing accessible without log in
  * That's by design, the only accessible pages should be
    * About
    * Login and Register
    * 404
* Two buttons have rounded edges while everything else is "sharp" (The two log in buttons)
* Logo could be improved upon (bland)
* Whished the login button was the same as the other ones on the top
  * Buttons should be consistent now, updated in #69
* Likes that the buttons "light up" when you hover above them
* The logo maybe also should "light up"

## User 2

* Very nice log in system, clear about things
* I dont like the logo
* boring colour theme, perhaps minimalistic
* clear input system for comments and name and number
* not good transition between upload cv and cv list
  * Updated the creation flow by adding an alert (immediate feedback) and redirecting to the created entity

## User 3

* the design is simple and straight-forward, which is good in my opinion
* Maybe you could have a general scoreboard for the "top applicants"
  * Not applicable, since we don't have a general ranking but the ranking depends entirely on the search.
    One candidate might be a good fit for one role but a horrible fit for another. 
* now the only scoreboard shown is dependent on what I have searched for.
  * Again, that's by design. Maybe it should be made clearer, so we added some descriptions to the various pages.
* You have relevant menu pages.
* Some sort of feedback could be appreciated to have when submitting the CV, something like "Thanks for your submition!" as an alert
  * See also feedback by *User 2*, we updated the creation flow
* The application is also responsive, when used on a smart-phone.
* Maybe the logo could be shifted to left a bit
