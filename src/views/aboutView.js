      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        At CWeed, we want to solve the biggest challenges for organisation in recruiting new Candidates.
        The Recruiters and the managers have an uphill task of reviewing the tons of resumes that are being received.
        The filtering of the resumes, to find the relevant candidates for a position is time -consuming and difficult.
        In order to identify the right resources and reach out to them effectively, we need a quickest route and where the results are also ideal.
        CWeed provides with the perfect tool to upload CV’s and to search for relevant keywords in the candidate’s resume.
        We aim to make this solution to include more than just searching for the relevant keywords.
        It also looks at the words synonymous to the search term in the Resumes.
